          <p><i>"In Ford's debut novel, a depressed, slovenly man becomes an unlikely hero for mankind by bringing a message direct from God.</i></p>

          <p><i>Ford crafts some genuinely funny, strange, and sad moments in this novel... there are some inspired moments of lunacy. [Miracle Man] is an underdog story with wild, inventive craftsmanship."</i></p>

        <h4>Sometimes life becomes so unbearable,</h4>

        <p>it's time to throw in the towel.</p>

        <p>Tom Hranicky certainly thought so. Chronically unemployed, dumped by his wife and stuck in a dead-end trailer park with nothing but a three-legged dog for company, Tom decides it's time to take the Big Dirt Nap.</p>

        <p>But when he ties sixty weather balloons to a La-Z-Boy recliner to make his grand exit, something unexpected happens. He floats into heaven. Where he finds out he still has one champion in his corner: God Himself. Or Herself, as in Oprah, which is how God appears to Tom.</p>

        <p>God talks a reluctant Tom into returning to earth as God's envoy, to deliver a simple one-word message to the world. But it soon becomes painfully apparent that Tom might not be the man for the job.</p>

        <p>MIRACLE MAN is the story about a different kind of faith. The faith to believe in yourself once again, long after everyone else has stopped.</p>
